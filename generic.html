									<p>In a stacked finals filled with incredibly talented individuals from across Indonesia, our team (me, Rifqi and Favian) proudly secured 2nd place at Datavidia – ARKAVIDIA 9.0, a national data science competition hosted by Himpunan Mahasiswa Informatika (HMIF) ITB. During the preliminary round, We were tasked with forecasting national commodity prices. Instead of using typical GBDT or statistical models, we explored efficient deep learning-based forecasting methods. The final round involved a 5-hour live coding session, followed by a presentation the next day. The task: predict property rental prices. We focused on engineering text features using TF-IDF and optimized a LightGBM model. Our model achieved the best accuracy, though just barely. While we fell short during the presentation, I’m proud of our performance, especially while juggling our undergraduate theses.</p>

For the preliminary round, we submitted a paper titled “Aplikasi Fractional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks dalam Pemantauan Deforestasi di IKN,” where we applied data science to tackle environmental sustainability issues. In the final round, we faced a one-day Kaggle case study on air quality detection, followed by presenting our solution the following day.</p>

									<p>I participated in the Health Research & Innovation Competition organized by IMERI (Indonesia Medical Education and Research Institute) FK UI (Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia). The competition was themed "Sustainable Future: Convergence of Medical Technology and Green Solutions for a Better Life." Collaborating with a diverse team from backgrounds in health, business, and technology, we developed a prototype of a skin cancer detection app capable of identifying over 13 cancer types and other skin conditions. Unfortunately, we only managed to get into the final stage (Top 20 Finalist).</p>
